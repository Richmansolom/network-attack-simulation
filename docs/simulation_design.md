## Simulation Design

This document will describe the architecture and design decisions for the network attack simulation.

We will update this document as we implement each component from the Phase 2 specification:

- Event Manager / SimulationEngine
- Attack Generator
- Network Model
- Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
- Metrics Collector
- Integrated `NetworkAttackSimulation` wrapper
